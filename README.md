# ProcessAudiobooks-UI

Designed to be a tool meant to aid in handling generating audiobooks for [m4b-tool](https://github.com/sandreas/m4b-tool). It is simply a gui shell that can be used with any command line tool. The command line is expected to be a linux system over ssh. 
It was designed to simplify things so my father could easily make audiobooks without worrying about the command line flags being used.
